##This Verilog-based ALU project was developed using VS Code for coding, Icarus Verilog and GTKWave for simulation and waveform analysis, with ChatGPT assistance for code correction and debugging.

# ðŸ§® Basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog

This project implements a **4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** in Verilog HDL. It supports basic arithmetic and logical operations like **Addition**, **Subtraction**, **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT**, with testbench simulation and waveform analysis.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Supports the following operations using a 3-bit selector:
  | sel  | Operation | Description       |
  |------|-----------|-------------------|
  | 000  | ADD       | A + B             |
  | 001  | SUB       | A - B             |
  | 010  | AND       | A & B             |
  | 011  | OR        | A \| B            |
  | 100  | NOT       | ~A                |
  | else | DEFAULT   | result = 0        |

## ðŸ§  Objective

To design and simulate a basic ALU circuit using Verilog and validate its functionality using Icarus Verilog (compiler) and GTKWave (waveform viewer).
